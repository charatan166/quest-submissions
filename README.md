## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quests


1-Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words:
  -An immutable and traceable chronological chain database that is linked together through cryptography

2-Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you

-They are programming in the block chain. Error free because they are intelligent, automated, digital and without intermediaries.

3-Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

-the script is the common language used between the parties of a transfer to be able to execute the exchange of the token.

-The script is an instruction "embedded in the transaction" is an algorithm used to communicate orders.  It is the language in which transactions are communicated

-It would be like serotonin transfers


### Chapter 1 Day 2 Quests

1.Safe - because of the structure of the language
Clarity - easy to read language
Approachability - easy to write language
Developer Experience - easy to track errors in the code
Resource Oriented Programming - resources are what we will need to work with.

2.This is a language specially created for smart contracts. The laconically constructed structure makes it easy to audit the code. Which increases the security and clarity of the code. The language is designed in such a way, that you can easily to learn to write the code not only with experience but also without programming skills. Cadence is resource-oriented, which makes it unique and helps a lot in working with blockchain.
